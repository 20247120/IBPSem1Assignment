        "### Conclusions\n",
        "#### Price Volatility Testing\n",
        "Altering the price volatility greatly impacts the expected shape of the price trends, with higher volatility causing a more turbulent price. Interestingly, as price volatility decreases, the impact of supply disruption appears to affect the immediate price more, suggesting an inverse correlation between price volatility and disruption severity.\n",
        "Additionally, it appears that as the volatility approaches 0, the resource price tends more toward a general upward trend over the course of the simulation - and therefore as it approaches 1, the severity of the fluctuations correlate to a negative price trend.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Supply Disruption Impact Testing\n",
        "As expected, increasing disruption severity drastically increases the change in resource price during and after the supply disruption day, but trends following the disruption day are inconsistent across multiple trends, suggesting that the disruption severity does not have a significant effect on the overall trend of the price fluctuation.\n",
        "It was observed that, due to the nature of the values being further away from 0, multiplicatively increasing the disruption severity value creates a far greater disparity between the price fluctuation caused than multiplicatively decreasing the value. This is to say that: doubling the disruption severity creates a much larger difference in resource price compared to the control as halving the disruption severity.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Hedging Strategy Testing\n",
        "TBA\n",
        "\n",
        "### Challenges and Further Research\n",
        "Due to the nature of the resource fluctuation tests having an element of randomness to them (by virtue of using NumPy's numpy.random.normal() function to determine the distribution of resource prices), multiple tests performed in the same batch that alter only one variable will not display the exact differences without a specified random seed. This was fixed by generating the random seed on a per-batch (rather than per-test) basis.\n",
