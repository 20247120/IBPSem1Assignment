        "#### Price Volatility Testing\n",
        "Altering the price volatility greatly impacts the expected shape of the price trends, with higher volatility causing a more turbulent price. Interestingly, as price volatility decreases, the impact of supply disruption appears to affect the immediate price more, suggesting an inverse correlation between price volatility and disruption severity.\n",
        "Additionally, it appears that as the volatility approaches 0, the resource price tends more toward a general upward trend over the course of the simulation - and therefore as it approaches 1, the severity of the fluctuations correlate to a negative price trend.\n",
